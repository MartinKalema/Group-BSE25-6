# CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application

This project implements a CI/CD pipeline for a web application, utilizing tools like GitHub Actions, Docker, ESBuild, Kubernetes, CodeCov, Selenium, and more to automate workflows, containerize applications, and manage deployments. The pipeline emphasizes continuous integration, automated testing, and deployment to staging and production environments.


## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Git
- Docker
- Node.js and npm
- Kubernetes (minikube or any other Kubernetes distribution)
- ESBuild
- GitHub account

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-repo.git
   cd project-repo

2. **Install Dependencies Navigate to the frontend and backend directories to install the required packages:**
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
        cd frontend
        npm install
    # Install backend dependencies
        cd ../backend
        npm install

    # Install backend dependencies
        cd ../backend
        npm install


3. **Setup Docker Build and run the Docker containers for the frontend and backend applications:**
   ```bash
   # Build and start the Docker containers
    docker-compose up --build

4. **Deploy to Kubernetes (Staging) Deploy the application to your Kubernetes environment:**
   ```bash
   # Apply the Kubernetes deployment configuration
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

5. **Run Tests Run unit and integration tests to ensure the application works as expected**
   ```bash
   # Run tests for the application
   npm test

6. **Run Tests Run unit and integration tests to ensure the application works as expected**
   ```bash
   npm start


## Project Architecture

The project is a full-stack web application with CI/CD implementation that automates the development lifecycle from code integration to deployment. Below is the architectural breakdown:

- **Frontend**: Developed using React, with ESBuild for efficient bundling and optimization.
- **Backend**: Built with Node.js and Express, managing the server-side logic and API endpoints.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Configured using GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments. It ensures that code quality checks and automated tests are run on every push.
- **Containerization**: Docker is used for containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across development, staging, and production environments.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manages the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers.
- **Testing**: Selenium is used for end-to-end testing, while CodeCov checks code coverage.
- **Monitoring**: Grafana, Prometheus, or Datadog are integrated to monitor application performance and system health.
